## [Unreleased]

### BREAKING
- `#[auth_script]` attribute macro is required to mark the authentication procedure in the authentication component #1051
- The auto-generated `crate::bindings::Account` struct is removed. Declare the account
  explicitly with `#[account(...)]` and use that type as the note/tx-script entrypoint account
  parameter #1157
- `#[component]` no longer applies to structs or inherent impl blocks. An account component is
  now written as a `#[component_storage]` struct declaring the storage fields, a `#[component]`
  trait declaring the API, and a `#[component] impl Trait for Storage` block providing the
  behavior. The WIT interface name derives from the trait name, and `[lib].namespace` in
  `miden-project.toml` must equal the full `miden:<package>/<interface>@<version>` id (package
  from the kebab-cased `[package].name`, version from `miden-project.toml`) #697
- Storage slot names now derive from the `[lib].namespace` interface segment instead of the
  storage struct name. Slot names feed `StorageSlotId` derivation, so a component whose storage
  struct name does not match the interface segment gets different slot ids on recompile. Note
  that this also means renaming the component trait (and updating `[lib].namespace` to match)
  re-keys the storage slot ids of an already-deployed component #697

### Added
- `#[account(...)]` on an empty struct generates a typed account wrapper exposing the methods
  of the account component packages listed in the attribute. The same type serves both as the
  transaction's native (active) account — when passed to a `#[note]`/`#[tx_script]` entrypoint —
  and as a foreign account caller created with `new(account_id)`, whose method calls are routed
  through `execute_foreign_procedure` (FPI) #1157
  For example:
  ```rust
  let counter = CounterContract::new(counter_account_id);
  let count = counter.get_count();
  ```

## [0.11.0]

### BREAKING
- `Felt` and `Word` API changes (unified with the off-chain API).
- `Recipient::compute` removed in favor of `build_recipient` binding.
- Account storage `StorageMap` became `StorageMap<K,V>` and `Value` became `StorageValue<T>` where `K`, `V` and `T` have to be convertible to and from `Word` #987

### Fixed
- Fixed `pipe_words_to_memory` binding;


## [0.10.0]

### BREAKING
- Remove `miden::active_note::add_assets_to_account` #932
- `*_note::get_metadata` now returns `NoteMetadata` (2 `Word`s) #932

## [0.9.0]

### BREAKING
- Note scripts now use a struct-based API: replace `#[note_script] fn run(...)` with `#[note]` on a note input `struct` and `#[note]` on an inherent `impl` block containing exactly one `#[note_script]` entrypoint method #890. See an example: [before](https://github.com/0xMiden/project-template/blob/6cd50a3312dffba1826fd4f812bc431da7f51d5f/contracts/increment-note/src/lib.rs) and [after](https://github.com/0xMiden/project-template/blob/1dd023311021800002e3a9fb687e936991877e65/contracts/increment-note/src/lib.rs).
- Storage slot IDs are now derived from slot names; `#[storage(slot(...))]`/`slot(...)` is no longer supported, and slot name / id collisions are detected at compile time #907
- SDK bindings updated for VM v0.20 / protocol v0.13 (some bindings changed, e.g. `output_note::create(tag, note_type, recipient)`) #907
  - Previously auxiliary data could be passed into `output_note::create`. Now it can be attached to a note with `output_note::set_word_attachment`.
- Renamed `AccountId::from` to `AccountId::new` #808

### Added
- `ToFeltRepr` and `FromFeltRepr` traits with `derive` macros for felt-representation encoding/decoding #808
- `Word::from_u64_unchecked` constructor #894
- Assert `value <= Felt::M` in `Felt::from_u64_unchecked` #891

### Fixed
- Reverse the return values of `NativeAccount::add_asset` #862
- Correct operand order in `Felt` `le`/`lt` op bindings #882

## [0.8.0]

### BREAKING
- Require `&mut` in mutating methods of the account storage;

### Added

- Pass an account as a parameter to note and tx script #798
- `ActiveAccount` and `NativeAccount` traits to call tx kernel functions via `self.*` on an account #801
- Expose `miden::note::build_recipient_hash` tx kernel function Rust equivalent as `Recipient::compute` #823
- Assert range in `Felt` constructor, moving some range checks from runtime to compile time #891

## [0.7.1](https://github.com/0xMiden/compiler/compare/miden-v0.7.0...miden-v0.7.1) - 2025-11-13

## [0.7.0]
### BREAKING
